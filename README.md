# laundry_scraper

This is a webscraping tool that allows you to check the status of the washing machines at Cal Poly. 

Currently a work in progress...check back later for an additional description.

Can be used across all of campus housing, just requires you to change the URLs in machine_spider.py to that of your desired building. Currently, it is set to scrape both laundry rooms located in Trinity Hall.
